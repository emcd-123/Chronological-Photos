# Chronological Photos
 This is a simple program that organizes photos by when they were taken. The path to the directory of photos that you want to organize
 is input as a command line argument. When this is input, it will organize all the photos within the directory by renaming them in the order that they were shot based on DateTime metadata. (0.jpg, 1.jpg, etc...) Built this as a small project to help me make my brother's high school graduation ceremony powerpoint.
